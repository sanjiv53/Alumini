      <h3>Sri RamaKrishna Vivekananda Hr.Sec.School - Thiruppunavasal</h3>
      <p>Welcome to Sri Ramakrishna Vivekananda Higher Secondary School (S.R.V.HSS), Thiruppunavasal, an institution established in 1985, nestled in the rural heart of Pudukkottai District, Tamil Nadu. Founded with the ideals of Swami Vivekananda and inspired by the guidance of Sri Ramakrishna Tapovanam, our school has been dedicated to providing holistic education that nurtures the intellectual, moral, and spiritual growth of students from Grades 6 to 12. 
        Under the auspices of the renowned Sri Ramakrishna Tapovanam, founded by Swami Chidbhavananda, our school is part of a larger mission working towards educational, spiritual, and cultural advancement across Tamil Nadu. This mission, with branches in various parts of the state, operates 64 schools and seven colleges, bringing quality education and values-based learning to thousands of students. Our campus upholds this tradition, offering education rooted in the values of integrity, character building, and self-reliance. At S.R.K.V.HSS, we believe in the holistic development of each child. Our facilities include well-maintained classrooms, a playground, a library with over 5,000 books, and essential amenities such as electricity, safe drinking water, and separate toilets for boys and girls. With a growing emphasis on technology in education, our school also offers computer access for teaching and learning purposes.
         Additionally, we are proud to support our students’ well-being with a mid-day meal program.</p>

         <h3>Our Vision</h3>
         <p>In alignment with the vision of Sri Ramakrishna Tapovanam, our goal is to develop future leaders with strong moral values, resilience, and a commitment to serve their community and country. Inspired by Swami Vivekananda’s teachings, we aim to impart education that not only strengthens the intellect but also builds character and self-reliance, empowering students to contribute meaningfully to society.Our Legacy Our school is part of a legacy that dates back to 1942, when Sri Ramakrishna Tapovanam was established at Tirupparaithurai by Swami Chidbhavananda. This institution has since grown into a network of educational centers across Tamil Nadu, known for instilling in students the ideals of service, spirituality, and self-discipline. Our alumni carry forward these values in diverse fields, 
          standing as testimony to the transformative power of the education they received here.</p>
          <p>Through this website, we hope to reconnect with our alumni and create a network that celebrates the achievements of our school and its students.
